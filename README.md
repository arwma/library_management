# library_management
A software project called the Library Management System was created to automate and simplify library operations. The system is designed to improve the efficiency of library operations by including functions like book inventory management, user account administration, and tracking of book borrowings and returns. In addition to managing user accounts and creating reports for improved insights into library activity, users may simply add, update, and remove books. The project, which is based on the Django framework, offers administrators and users an intuitive interface that helps with the efficient management and upkeep of library resources.
## Features

- Add, update, and delete books in the library inventory.
- Manage user accounts and permissions.
- Track book borrowings and returns.
- Generate reports on book availability, overdue books, etc.
